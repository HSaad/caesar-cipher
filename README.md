## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the text is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

This website encodes messages using the Caesar Cipher and was made using Sinatra and deployed on Heroku.
